You moved on from the coding tutorials, and you took the plunge to begin building your own projects to show off what you learned. You become the architect who  the evolution of whole project from a barebones wireframe to a minimally desirable product and beyond. So you confidently move onto another. You find yourself faced with a challenge that can be solved by a function in one of your earlier projects. You created something reusable and efficient. An algorithm. So what do you do? Do you sift through that old project to find that exact function? To navigate through directories in terminal, go through line after line to understand what your strategy was back then? Did you take notes? Leave comments? Do you make a repository on GitHub to hold onto those snippets? Manually organize them into directories and then reference them in your `README.me`?

Did you create a Gist on GitHub? Do you have a lot of gists? Ever notice how you can't really sort gists by categories? Do you use PasteBin? Oh, wait, you need to upgrade to the PRO account to even organize your snippets. And they're currently sold out of PRO accounts.

There's a whole process to holding onto these snippets of code. They're so important. Why can't this be as easy as when you created flashcards to study for a test? Flashcards are awesome. You could pick them up at a store and they come with a little plastic portfolio to store them. You reference them, you remember them. Yes, you can google your way through a project, but does it help you understand what's going on? Are you googling to solve a problem, or to learn? Can you commit these strategies and paradigms to memory and apply them later on? Wouldn't you want to also save the things you've learned from your rabbit holes on Google?

This is where \`mthd comes in. \`mthd is like GitHub Gists, but as flashcards.

## Getting Started

You can get started with \`mthd in one of two ways.

You can fork this repository, clone it. Navigate to the root directory, do a quick `bundle install`, `rails db:migrate`, `rails db:seed`, and then start the server with `rails s`. Open up your browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:3000/user/login`.

Or you can visit [this link](tbd). Either or works.

Since you're new here, you're prompted to create a new account. Your input gets added into a table with columns for your username, your encrypted password, and your profile photo.

You're directed to your dashboard. And here's where the magic takes place. Your navbar on the left gives you the option to edit your account, create a snippet or log out. On the right, you can see all of your snippets and categories in one place. Clicking each snippet shows you
